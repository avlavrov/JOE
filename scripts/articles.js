    articleAbstract: 'The majority of CRISPR-Cas9 methods for mutations correction are oriented on gene editing through homologous recombination that is normally restrained by non- homologous end joining(NHEJ).A recently identified protein TIRR can bind a 53BP1 protein, a key effector of NHEJ, and inhibit its recruitment to double - strand break loci.Several studies elucidated the molecular mechanisms of TIRR - 53BP1 binding and established bidirectional role of TIRR in 53BP1 functions and stability.It was proved that overexpression of TIRR promotes the double - strand break repair through homologous recombination.All findings, which were described in the review, allow assuming TIRR as a suitable target for enhancing efficacy of genome editing through homology directed repair.',
